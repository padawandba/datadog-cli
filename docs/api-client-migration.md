# Datadog API Client Migration

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the Datadog CLI to use the latest Datadog API client v2 features and best practices.

## Overview

The Datadog CLI was already using the v2 API client package (`github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-go/v2`), but it was not fully leveraging the latest features and best practices. The migration focused on improving the following areas:

1. **Parameter Initialization**: Using proper constructor methods for optional parameters
2. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with HTTP response details
3. **Resource Management**: Improved context handling and cleanup
4. **Type Safety**: Using getter and setter methods instead of direct field access

## Changes Made

### Hosts Client

- Updated `ListHostsOptionalParameters` initialization to use the constructor method
- Improved error handling with HTTP response details
- Enhanced parameter passing with proper chaining of option methods
- Used getter methods for response objects
- Improved request body initialization with proper constructor methods

### Tags Client

- Updated `GetHostTagsOptionalParameters` and `CreateHostTagsOptionalParameters` initialization
- Enhanced error handling with HTTP response details
- Improved tag filtering logic with a dedicated helper function
- Used proper constructor methods for request bodies
- Simplified the tag removal logic for better maintainability

### Monitors Client

- Updated `ListMonitorsOptionalParameters` initialization
- Enhanced error handling with HTTP response details
- Improved request body initialization with proper constructor methods
- Used getter and setter methods for monitor options
- Added proper error handling for monitor updates

### Datadog Client

- Maintained backward compatibility with the existing configuration
- Improved logging for API requests and responses
- Enhanced error handling for transport-level errors
- Ensured proper cleanup of resources with context cancellation

## Benefits

The migration to the latest Datadog API client v2 features and best practices provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and resource management
2. **Enhanced Debugging**: More detailed error messages with HTTP response information
3. **Better Maintainability**: Consistent use of constructor methods and getter/setter methods
4. **Reduced Risk**: Proper initialization of objects reduces the risk of nil pointer errors
5. **Future Compatibility**: Following best practices ensures compatibility with future versions

## Next Steps

While the current implementation continues to use the v1 API endpoints (datadogV1) for hosts, tags, and monitors, the code is now better structured to migrate to v2 endpoints when they become available. The Datadog API is gradually migrating endpoints from v1 to v2, and the current implementation will make it easier to adopt those changes in the future.
